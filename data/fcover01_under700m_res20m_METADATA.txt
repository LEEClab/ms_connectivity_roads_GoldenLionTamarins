# Maps

The habitat map presented here, 'fcover01_under700m_res20m.tif', corresponds to 
the forest class of the land use map produced by the Brazilian Foundation
for Sustainable Development (in portuguese, Fundação Brasileira para o 
Desenvolvimento Sustentável, FBDS).

The original land use classes in FBDS raster are:
1 = water
2 = antropic areas
3 = areas with buildings
4 = forest 
5 = non forest natural areas
6 = silviculture

Only forests (class 4) with elevation lower than 700m were selected here, since these 
correspond to most common used habitat for golden lion tamarins. FBDS maps were 
created with resolution 5m but here were transformed to resolution 20m for area 
and landscape metrics calculations, and presented in matricial format (raster).

We also present the map "fcover01_under700m_res20m_HABITAT.shp", a vetorial map of
all forests in the study area, regardless of elevation. This was the original
forest map from FBDS used for producing the matricial map cited above.
